# SCPa Works Grant Administration

The SCPa Works Grant Administration portal is powered by SurveyMonkey Apply (often abbreviated SMApply), a platform for managing grant and scholarship applications, approvals, and awards.

There are three primary roles in SMApply:
1. Admins - create and manage programs, users/reviewers, and the website
2. Reviewers - staff members assigned to review and rate applications
3. Users - standard users applying for grants/programs

The tutorials are categorized by user role. Select the appropriate role category on the left to find relevant tutorials.
