## How Does Classroom Work?

Classroom is divided into two user roles: <b>Teacher</b> and <b>Student</b>.

A <b>Teacher</a> is a manager of classrooms and content. Teachers are able to create classrooms, upload and organize content, assign work to students, and have other management abilities.

A <b>Student</a> is a viewer/consumer of classroom content. Students are able to view and interact with content, collaborate in shared spaces, submit assignments, and communicate with fellow students.
