## What are Reminders?

Apptoto provides reminder functionality through **Auto Messages.** These are SMS (text) messages, emails, or voice calls that Apptoto automatically sends to participants of an event at predetermined times.

There are three types of Auto Messages in Apptoto:
* **Initial/Booking** - sent at some time after the participant books an appointment
* **Reminder** - sent at some time before the appointment occurs
* **Followup** - sent at some time after the appointment is completed

**Rules** can be defined for reminders. These allow certain reminders to be sent out when specific content is included in an appointment. For instance, we can define a custom data type in an event as follows:

<a href="/assets/apptoto/customData.png"><img src="/assets/apptoto/customData.png" /></a>

Then, we can create reminders using Rules that are sent only when that appointment contains the `type: class` data field.
