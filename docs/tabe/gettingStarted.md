## How are You Taking Your Test?

Before you begin, you need to determine how you are taking your test.

**If you are taking your test at a physical PA CareerLink location or partner location**, please talk to your Career Advisor for assistance. They are the best resource to guide you in getting started.

Your Career Advisor may tell you that you will be taking your test on a computer. To use this guide, ask them if you will be using a **Chromebook** or **Windows device**.

**If you are taking your test remotely (at home),** please skip to the <a href="#Remote-TABE-Testing">Remote TABE Testing</a> section.
