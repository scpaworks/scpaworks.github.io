     2. USB Type-B cable <img src="/assets/scansnap/2usb.png" />
     3. AC power cable <img src="/assets/scansnap/3acCable.png" />
     4. AC power adapter <img src="/assets/scansnap/4acAdapter.png" />
     5. Receipt guide <img src="/assets/scansnap/5receiptGuide.png" />
     6. Welcome Guide paper <img src="/assets/scansnap/6welcomeGuide.png" />
     7. Safety Precautions paper <img src="/assets/scansnap/7safety.png" />
     8. License certificate for *Kofax/Nuance Power PDF* <img src="/assets/scansnap/8kofaxPDFlic.png" />
2. Unwrap the scanner, AC power cable and adapter, and USB type-B cable from their plastic coverings.
3. Insert the AC power cable into the AC adapter.
4. Plug the USB type-B cable into the scanner and your computer. Plug the type-B end into the scanner, and the USB end into your computer.
5. Make sure you remove all tape from the scanner and remove the protective card inside.
6. Open the scanner and ensure the screen lights up, then proceed to Configuring the Scanner.

### Configuring the Scanner
1. Before you configure the software on your computer, you'll need to set up the ScanSnap. On the first screen that appears, select your preferred language.

2. The Limited Warranty Guide page will appear. Tap **Next** to proceed.

3. Select a Startup mode according to your needs. In Fast startup mode, the scanner is always in standby and is ready for use as soon as the scanner lid is opened. In Normal startup mode, the scanner will power off when the lid is closed, and power on when it is opened. Fast mode is about 5-10 seconds faster than Normal mode. **Tap to select your preferred startup mode, then tap Next to continue.**

5. On the Connection Method page, select the mode through which you will be connecting your scanner to your computer. **USB** is recommended, and you can set up Wi-Fi connection during the USB setup process. If you would like to connect directly through Wi-Fi, select Wi-Fi (Access point connection). Tap to select your choice, then tap **Next** to proceed.

Tap **OK** to save your input and return to the Connection Information page.
