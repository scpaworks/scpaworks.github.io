# How to Backup your Data

This guide will show you how to backup your data on Windows 10 and Windows 7. The methods shown demonstrate how to store data on external drives (USB flash drives or external hard drives) or network drives. If you are using a cloud location (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) please see the Cloud Storage section.

2. Prepare your backup location.
     1. If you are using a cloud location, continue to use the below steps, following that platform’s procedures for creating new folders and uploading files/folders.
     2. Create folders for each library you are backing up. To do this, click Home in the Ribbon Menu and select New folder under the New category. A new folder will appear and you will be prompted to enter a name. Once the name is entered the folder is created.
