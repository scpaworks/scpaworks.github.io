This guide will show you how to backup your data on Windows 10 and Windows 7. The methods shown demonstrate how to store data on external drives (USB flash drives or external hard drives) or network drives. If you are using a cloud location (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) please see the Cloud Storage section.

2. Prepare your backup location.
     1. If you are using a cloud location, continue to use the below steps, following that platform’s procedures for creating new folders and uploading files/folders.
     2. Create folders for each library you are backing up. To do this, click Home in the Ribbon Menu and select New folder under the New category. A new folder will appear and you will be prompted to enter a name. Once the name is entered the folder is created.

     3. Your backup location should now look like the below image. You should have an empty folder for each location you plan to backup.

3. Begin backing up your data.
     1. Go to the folder you want to backup and select all the files. Either press Ctrl + A or click the checkbox at the top of the file list to select everything.

## Cloud Services

The procedure for each cloud storage location will differ. Refer to the official help documentation for your particular service if the below guide does not assist you.

### Google Drive / Gsuite

2. Begin preparing your storage location for the files.
     1. Create a new folder for your backup. Click New > Folder and give it a name (i.e. Backup).

          <a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup1.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup1.png" /></a><a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup2.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup2.png" /></a>

     2. Navigate to your new folder by double-clicking on it. Make a new folder for each library you are backing up.

          <a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup3.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup3.png" /></a><a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup4.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup4.png" /></a>

3. Begin uploading files to Google Drive, storing them in their corresponding folders.
     1. You can drag and drop selected files into your directory in Drive to upload them. To do this, select all files you’d like to save and drag them to the Drive window. If you need assistance on selecting files, refer to the above OS-specific tutorials.

          <a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup6.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup6.png" /></a><a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup7.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/drivebackup7.png" /></a>

     3. Repeat the uploading process until all files you want backed up are stored in your Google Drive. Double-check each directory and subdirectories to ensure all files transferred correctly.

### Microsoft OneDrive

     1. Create a new folder for your backup (i.e. Backups). To do this, click New > Folder and enter a name.

          <a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup1.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup1.png" /></a><a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup2.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup2.png" /></a>

     2. Navigate into your new folder by clicking it. Create a folder for each directory you plan to back up on your OneDrive.

          <a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup3.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup3.png" /></a><a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup4.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup4.png" /></a>

3. Begin uploading files to OneDrive, storing them in their corresponding folders.
     1. You can drag and drop selected files into a OneDrive directory. For assistance selecting files, refer to the guide for your operating system above.

          <a class="image" href="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup5.png"><img src="/assets/computerskills/ODbackup5.png" /></a>

     2. Alternatively, you can upload files by folder using the Upload button. Click Upload > Folder and select the folder you want to upload.

     3. Repeat the uploading process until all files you want backed up are stored in your Google Drive. Double-check each directory and subdirectories to ensure all files transferred correctly.

### Other Cloud Service
Please refer to the two above guides. The process for other cloud services (Dropbox, MEGA, etc.) should be very similar to OneDrive and Google Drive. If you run into problems, check the official help documentation provided with that service.
